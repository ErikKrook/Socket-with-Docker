# LearnDocker

This project serves as my introduction to Docker and Web sockets. Here, I explore the basics of containerization, message exchange between containers via TCP, and orchestration using Docker Compose.

To run the project, simply execute:

```bash
docker-compose up # starting up the containers

docker-compose down # shuting down the containers

docker-compose restart # restart the container (same as runing docker-compose down and then docker-compose up)
